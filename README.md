# Important Notes #

- Since the both projects are too small, consisting of just a few files, therefore the files are not organized properly. In production, we do have modules properly organized into their separate directories.
- In the first task, api/avatars directory contains the image files
- In the second task, cron/data contains the users.json file. Which is used to store the users data.
