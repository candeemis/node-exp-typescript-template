# ExpressJs + Typescript Template Project

To use this template project:

1. simply clone it with `git clone https://github.com/nadeemjamali/node-exp-typescript-template.git <your-project-name>`
2. then install npm packages using `npm install`
3. test it with `npm test`
4. verify it with `npm start` and Postman
5. build it with `npm run build`

I have used Factory pattern to resolve dependencies, you can extend it or replace it with your own choice of architecture!
